      <section class="main-section" id="Basic_Types_of_Fabrics">
        <header>Basic Types of Fabrics</header>
        <p>Fabrics are typically classified into three primary types based on the origin and processing of their fibers: natural, synthetic, and artificial (or semi-synthetic). This classification helps designers evaluate a fabric’s behavior, properties and sustainability profile.</p>
          <h1>Natural Fibers</h1>
          <p>These are made from raw fibers derived directly from plants or animals, with minimal chemical processing. Natural fabrics tend to be breathable, biodegradable, and comfortable against the skin. They respond well to dyeing and finishing techniques but may wrinkle easily or shrink without proper treatment. Common examples include cotton, linen, hemp, and ramie (plant-based), as well as silk, wool, cashmere, and mohair (animal-based).
          </p>
          <h1>Synthetic Fibers</h1>
          <p>Fully man-made through polymerization of petrochemical compounds, synthetic fabrics are engineered for durability, elasticity, and resistance to moisture and abrasion. They often have low breathability but are lightweight, fast-drying, and cost-effective to produce at scale. Common examples are polyester, polyamide (nylon), acrylic, and elastane.
            </p>
          <h1>Semi-synthetic Fibers</h1>
          <p>
Unlike synthetic fibers made from petrochemicals, semi-synthetics retain a natural base structure. These fabrics are made from natural raw materials like wood pulp, which contain long-chain polymers (usually cellulose). The fibers are chemically processed and regenerated, but not fully synthetic. The most common examples are viscose, modal, lyocell, and cupro.</p>

          <h2>Natural Fibers</h2>
          <h3>Cotton</h3>
          <div class="container-img">
            <div><p>Cotton is a natural fiber harvested from the cotton plant, with a cultivation history that spans thousands of years. It produces fabric that is lightweight, soft, and highly breathable. Thanks to its excellent moisture absorption, cotton fabrics are very comfortable to wear in warm weather. This makes cotton a healthy choice for everyday clothing, especially for those with sensitive skin or allergies.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Common uses: </span> T-shirts, dresses, shirts, bedsheets, casual wear, denim.</p></div>

          </div>
          <h3>Wool</h3>
          <p>Wool is a natural animal fiber obtained primarily from sheep.  It has been used in textiles for thousands of years, especially in colder climates due to its excellent insulation, durability and moisture-wicking properties. Wool fibers naturally repel moisture while allowing breathability, keeping the wearer warm and dry. They resist wrinkling and maintain their shape well, thanks to their natural elasticity. However, wool requires careful handling to avoid shrinking or felting during washing.</p>
          <p>There are several specialty wools, each with unique origins and characteristics:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">Wool: </span>from sheep, offering a balance of warmth, resilience, and breathability, though it can sometimes irritate the skin and cause allergies.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Cashmere: </span>sourced from the undercoat of Kashmir goats, known for its exceptional softness and lightweight warmth.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Mohair: </span>derived from the Angora goat, mohair fibers are strong, silky, and have a natural sheen with good elasticity.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Alpaca: </span>harvested from alpacas native to South America, this fiber is soft, lightweight, and warmer than sheep’s wool, with excellent hypoallergenic properties.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Angora: </span>comes from Angora rabbits, producing a fine, fluffy fiber renowned for its exceptional softness and insulation.</li>
</ul>
          <p><span class="bold">Common uses:</span> Coats, sweaters, scarves, suits, blankets, and upholstery.</p>

        <h1>Synthetic Fibers</h1>
        <h3>Polyester</h3>
          <p>Polyester is a fully synthetic fiber made from petrochemicals, primarily derived from petroleum. It is strong, durable, wrinkle-resistant, and holds its shape well. Polyester dries quickly and is often blended with natural fibers to improve performance and reduce cost.</p>
          <p>While it's affordable and versatile, polyester is not breathable and can trap moisture and odors, which can lead to skin irritations and even infections. It’s also non-biodegradable and sheds microplastics during washing, which contributes to water pollution.</p>
          <p><span class="bold">Common uses: </span> Sportswear, outerwear, everyday clothing, home textiles like curtains and upholstery.</p>
        <h3>Polyamide</h3>
          <p> Polyamide, commonly known as nylon, is a strong, lightweight synthetic fiber known for its excellent abrasion resistance and elasticity. It dries quickly and has good wrinkle resistance, making it ideal for activewear and durable textiles. While nylon is durable and versatile, it is non-breathable and can retain odors, just like polyester. It's just as well non-biodegradable and contributes to microplastic pollution during washing.</p>
          <p><span class="bold">Common uses:</span> Activewear, hosiery, swimwear, jackets and outdoor, luggage, upholstery.</p>
          <h3>Elastane</h3>
            <p>Elastane, known also as spandex or Lycra®, is a highly elastic synthetic fiber made from polyurethane. Known for its exceptional stretch and recovery, it can expand up to five times its length and return to its original shape. It’s rarely used alone but blended with other fibers to add flexibility and comfort. Elastane is lightweight and smooth, but it’s non-biodegradable and sensitive to heat and harsh chemicals, so elastane blends need careful handling.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Common uses:</span> Sportswear, swimwear, leggings, underwear, fitted garments.</p>
          <h3>Acrylic</h3>
            <p>Acrylic is designed to mimic the softness and warmth of wool. It is lightweight, quick-drying, and resistant to moths, sunlight, and chemicals. However, it tends to pill over time and it's not as breathable nor durable as wool. Acrylic holds color well and is often used as a low-cost alternative to natural fibers, but it's important to notice it's non-biodegradable, contributing to microplastic pollution. It's also flammable and should be handled with care near heat.</p>
<p>Common uses: Knitwear, sweaters, scarves, blankets, faux fur, and home textiles.</p>

        <article>
        <h1 id="semi-synthetic_fibers">Semi-Synthetic Fibers</h1>
          <h3>Viscose</h3>
            <p>Viscose is made by chemically processing cellulose from wood pulp. It combines the breathability of natural fibers with the smooth, silky feel of synthetic fabrics. Viscose drapes well, is lightweight, and absorbs moisture effectively, making it comfortable to wear. However, viscose wrinkles easily and can weaken and stretch when wet, so it requires gentle care. </p>
<p><span class="bold">Common uses:</span> Dresses, skirts, blouses, scarves, linings.</p>

          <figcaption>Wood chip, raw material from which viscose is made.</figcaption></span>
  </div>
          <h3>Cupro</h3>
          <p>Cupro is a regenerated cellulose fiber made from cotton linter, the short fibers left after cotton processing. It has a smooth, silky texture and excellent breathability. Cupro drapes beautifully, feels cool on the skin, and is highly absorbent, which makes it very similar to silk. Cupro as well requires delicate care to prevent shrinking and wrinkles.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Common uses:</span> Blouses, dresses, shirts, scarves.</p>
          <h3>Lyocell</h3>
          <p>Lyocell, often known by the brand name Tencel, is a regenerated cellulose fiber made from sustainably sourced wood pulp, processed using a closed-loop system that recycles nearly all chemicals and water. It’s soft, breathable, and has excellent moisture-wicking properties, making it comfortable and cool to wear. It’s commonly blended with other fibers to improve fabric performance.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Common uses:</span> Casual wear, dresses, trousers, activewwear.</p>
          <h3>Modal</h3>
            <p>Modal is a type of regenerated cellulose fiber made from beech tree pulp. It is soft, smooth, and breathable, with excellent moisture absorption, making it comfortable for everyday wear. Modal drapes well and resists shrinking and pilling better than regular rayon. It's often used in knitted fabrics for enhanced activewear.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Common uses:</span> Underwear, activewear, loungewear, dresses.</p>
        <p>You may also come across the name <span class="bold">Rayon</span>. Rayon is the umbrella term for a group of regenerated cellulose fibers made from plant-based sources like wood pulp. Though it includes several types, such as viscose, modal, and lyocell,  it usually refers to <span class="bold">viscose</span>, which is the most common and traditional form of rayon. </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Weaves_and_Fabric_Structures">
        <header>Weaves and Fabric Structures</header>
        <p>Fabrics are typically constructed using two main techniques: weaving and knitting.</p>
        <p>Woven fabrics are made by interlacing two sets of yarns—warp (vertical) and weft (horizontal)—on a loom. This creates a stable, structured fabric with limited stretch.</p>
        <p>Knitted fabrics are formed by interlooping yarns into a series of rows (courses) and columns (wales). This looped structure makes them naturally stretchy, soft, and flexible.</p>
        <p>This section focuses on woven fabrics, where the way threads cross determines the weave pattern, influencing the fabric’s texture, drape, strength, and visual appearance. Different types of weaves offer varying characteristics suited to different design and functional needs. Here are some basic types of weaves.</p>
        <h2>Plain Weave</h2>
            <p>Plain weave is the most basic and widely used weaving structure. It’s created by alternating the warp and weft threads over and under each other in a consistent one-to-one pattern. This results in a flat, balanced surface with equal tension in both directions.
Plain weave fabrics tend to be firm, durable, and resistant to snagging. While they don’t drape as fluidly as some other weaves, they are easy to sew and versatile in use.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Examples:</span> cotton poplin, muslin, voile, chiffon, organza.</p>
<div class="container-img">
<span><figure><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/78/132378-050-2F30A89A/canvas-fabric.jpg" alt="Plain weave" loading="lazy"></figure>
          <figcaption>Plain weave</figcaption></span>
  </div>

          <h1>Twill Weave</h1>
          <p>Twill weave is characterized by diagonal lines on the fabric surface, created by offsetting the interlacing of warp and weft threads. The most typical pattern is “over two, under one,” repeated in staggered rows. Twill fabrics are strong, flexible, and more resistant to wrinkles and creases than plain weaves. They also have a softer drape and are commonly used in workwear and tailored garments.</p>
          <p><span class="bold">Examples:</span> denim, chino, gabardine, houndstooth.</p>
<div class="container-img">
<span><figure><img src="https://nationwidefabric.com/cdn/shop/products/CottonTwillLightGrey_1024x1024.jpg?v=1628098696" alt="Twill fabric" loading="lazy"></figure>
          <figcaption>Cotton twill fabric</figcaption></span>
  </div>

          <h1>Satin Weave</h1>
            <p>Satin weave creates a smooth, glossy surface by floating the warp or weft threads over multiple yarns before interlacing. These long floats reflect light, giving the fabric its characteristic shine. The result is a fluid, elegant fabric with excellent drape but lower resistance to abrasion and snagging. Satin is often used where a luxurious look and feel are desired.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Examples:<span> silk satin, charmeuse, duchess satin.</p>
      <div class="container-img">
      <span><figure><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/572acad64d088e15d931460d/1600907114793-BQJW2LQ4CFH4L8NZJQ09/Ivory+Silk+Satin+Sep+2020+5.jpg?format=1500w&content-type=image%2Fjpeg" alt="Satin fabric" loading="lazy"></figure>
          <figcaption>Silk satin</figcaption></span>
  </div>
            
          <h1>Herringbone Weave</h1>
            <p>Herringbone is a decorative variation of the twill weave. It forms a zigzag or “V-shaped” pattern by reversing the direction of the diagonal twill at regular intervals.
This weave combines the strength and softness of twill with a sophisticated, textured appearance. It's especially popular in classic menswear and interior textiles.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Examples:</span> wool suiting, outerwear fabrics, tweeds.</p>
      <div class="container-img">
      <span><figure><img src="https://www.woodbros.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/U1796-AK4.jpg" alt="Herringbone fabric" loading="lazy"></figure>
          <figcaption>Wool herringbone fabric</figcaption></span>
      </div>
          <h2>Basket Weave</h2>
            <p>Basket weave is a variation of plain weave in which two or more warp and weft threads are grouped together and woven in pairs (e.g., two-over-two). This produces a looser, more flexible structure with a subtle checkerboard texture. Basket weaves are breathable and often used in casual or sporty garments.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Examples:</span> canvas, oxford.</p>
      <div class="container-img">
      <span><figure><img src="https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-z9t2ne/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/57051/488962/skndeco522__40837__91549.1689777615.jpg?c=2" alt="Basket weave" loading="lazy"></figure>
          <figcaption>Basket weave</figcaption></span>
      </div>

          <h1>Jacquard</h1>
            <p>Jacquard weave allows for the creation of intricate and highly detailed woven patterns, such as florals, brocades, or geometric designs. It’s made using a special loom that controls each warp thread individually. These fabrics are often heavier and more structured, with complex textures and visual depth. Because of their decorative nature, jacquard weaves are frequently used in formalwear, upholstery, and high-end fashion.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Examples:</span> brocade, damask, matelassé, jacquard knits.</p>

        <header>Fabric Finishes</header>
        <p>Fabrics undergo various finishing processes after weaving or knitting to enhance their appearance, texture, durability, and functionality. These finishes can improve comfort, protect against elements, add decorative effects, or make care easier. Below are common types of finishes and treatments used in textile production.</p>
        <article>
          <h1>Fabric Finishes That Affect Fabric Properties</h1> 
          <h3>Mercerization</h3>
            <p>A chemical treatment for cotton that increases luster, strength, and dye affinity by swelling and straightening fibers under tension. Results in a smoother, shinier fabric that resists shrinkage. Common in quality cotton garments and linens.</p>
          <h3>Brushing</h3>
            <p>Raising surface fibers with fine brushes to create a soft, fuzzy texture. Enhances warmth and comfort with a cozy matte look. Used in flannel, fleece, and winter-weight cotton.</p>

      <div class="container-img">

      </div>


          <h3>Anti-wrinkle / Easy-care Finish</h3>
            <p>Chemical treatments for natural fibers to reduce creasing and improve shape retention, minimizing ironing. Common in dress shirts, uniforms, and businesswear.</p>
          <h3>Flame Retardant Finish</h3>
            <p>Finishes that reduce flammability and slow fire spread, essential for protective clothing, children’s wear, upholstery, and curtains. Can be durable or temporary.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h1>Specialty and Aesthetic Fabric Finishes</h1> 
          <h3>Stone Washing</h3>
            <p>Using pumice stones or abrasives to soften fabric and create a faded, worn look. Adds comfort and reduces stiffness, mostly used for denim and casual cotton.</p>
      <div class="container-img">
      <span><figure><img src="https://u-mercari-images.mercdn.net/photos/m69872773565_5.jpg" alt="Stone wash on denim" loading="lazy"></figure>
          <figcaption>Stone wash on denim</figcaption></span>
      </div>

            
          <h3>Enzyme Washing</h3>
          <p>Eco-friendly and milder alternative to stone washing, using natural enzymes to break down fibers for softness and subtle fading. Common in cotton, linen, and viscose, to soften and add smooth handfeeling.</p>
          <h3>Sandblasting</h3>
            <p>Another finishing applicable to denim. It's a mechanical finish where high-pressure air mixed with abrasive particles is used to distress fabric surfaces. It gives textiles a rugged, vintage appearance.
This technique is being replaced by safer, more sustainable methods due to health concerns in production.</p>

            <h1>Dyeing</h1>
<p>Dyeing is the process of adding color to textile fibers, yarns, or fabrics using various dye substances. It can be done at different stages—fiber, yarn, fabric, or garment—and each method affects colorfastness, texture, and depth of tone.</p>
<p>Natural fibers generally absorb dyes better than synthetics. The method of dyeing—such as vat dyeing, reactive dyeing, or pigment dyeing—also determines the durability and intensity of color.</p>
<p>Common dyeing styles include solid color, ombré (gradient), or tie-dye effects.</p>

            <h1>Printing</h1>
<p>Printing involves applying color or design onto the surface of the fabric in specific patterns. It can be done using several techniques, including screen printing, digital printing, block printing, or rotary printing.
Printed fabrics allow for highly detailed and multicolored designs, unlike dyeing which is usually uniform. The feel and durability of the print depend on the ink, fabric type, and printing method used. Another finishing, such as enzyme washing, can be added to soften the printed fabric.</p>
<p>Printing is used extensively in fashion, interiors and textile.</p>

        <header>Sustainable Fabric Choices</header>
          <p>As environmental awareness grows, the fashion and textile industries are shifting toward more responsible material choices. Sustainable fabrics aim to reduce harm to ecosystems, minimize water and energy use, and promote ethical labor practices. This includes both naturally low-impact fibers and innovative alternatives made from recycled or renewable sources.</p>
<p>Certifications play a key role in verifying whether materials meet environmental and ethical standards. Understanding these options helps designers make informed decisions that support both people and the planet.</p>

          <h1>Organic Fibers</h1>
          <p>Natural fibers are valued for their breathability, comfort, and ability to biodegrade. However, their environmental impact depends on how they’re cultivated and processed. While they decompose more easily than synthetics, treatments like chemical dyeing can still harm the environment.</p>
          <p>Conventional cotton farming poses major sustainability issues due to high water use and heavy reliance on pesticides and fertilizers, which degrade soil and pollute waterways. In contrast, <span class="bold">organic cotton</span> is grown without synthetic chemicals, using less water and supporting soil health and biodiversity.</p> 
          <p>Flax cultivation, used to make <span class="bold">organic linen</span> typically requires fewer pesticides and less water than cotton, so it's naturally a more sustainable choice. 
Similarly, <span class="bold">organic wool</span> comes from sheep raised with strict animal welfare standards and sustainable land management.</p>

          <p>Certifications such as <span class="bold">GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard)</span> and <span class="bold">OEKO-TEX</span> play a crucial role in promoting these sustainable practices. GOTS certifies organic fiber production from farming through processing, ensuring strict environmental and social criteria. OEKO-TEX certifies that textiles are free from harmful chemicals, providing further assurance of sustainability and safety.</p>

        <header>Technical Documentation</header>
        <p>Providing accurate and detailed fabric information is essential in fashion production. The people who turn your design into a finished garment—pattern makers, seamstresses, suppliers, and production managers—rely on this data to correctly handle, cut, and sew the material. Incomplete or vague fabric documentation can lead to miscommunication, poor garment quality, or production delays.</p>
        <h1>Why Details Matter</h1>
        <p>Each fabric behaves differently. A stretch fabric requires a different pattern and sewing technique than a  rigid woven. A loosely woven wool may need stabilizing, while a delicate silk demands gentle handling. By specifying how a fabric behaves, you help ensure the final product meets design expectations in terms of fit, drape, durability, and comfort.</p>
        <h1>Key Information to Include</h1>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">Fabric Composition (%):</span> Lists fiber content (e.g. 70% cotton / 30% polyester). Helps determine stretch, shrinkage, care instructions, and behavior during sewing. </li>
            <li><span class="bold">Fabric Weight (g/m²):</span> Indicates heaviness or thickness. Affects drape, structure, and seasonality of the garment. </li>
            <li><span class="bold">Weave or Knit Type:</span> Plain weave, twill, jersey, etc. Impacts drape, flexibility, and construction techniques. </li>
            <li><span class="bold">Finishing:</span> Any treatments like pre-shrinking, brushing, waterproofing, or special coatings. Important for how the fabric behaves in use and during production. </li>
          </ul>
          <h1>Optional but Useful:</h1>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">Stretch % (if applicable):</span> For knits or fabrics with elastane, helps with pattern adjustment.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Shrinkage % (if applicable):</span> For fabrics undergoing heat or heavy treatments, like printing or stone-washing (denim)</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Fabric Width (cm):</span> Needed to calculate fabric consumption.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Care Instructions:</span> Guides pre-washing and post-production care.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Supplier / Code / Origin:</span> For traceability and re-ordering.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>A well-documented fabric spec ensures consistency, quality, and smooth collaboration from design to production.</p>
        <h1>Examples:</h1>
        <div class="technical-examples">
